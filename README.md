# HouseholdEnergySimulator

This project is a simulation of a household energy monitoring system.  
It offers an auto-demo for users to undertand how it works, and it supports multiple users. 

The project simulates a standard household with rooms equipped with classic utilities:
electricity, natural gas, water. The user is able to manipulate the consumption
of these utilities by turning on and off household devices such as light switches, 
watertaps, heating systems, kitchen cooking appliances. 
The system provides measurement meters for each type of utility, that update 
and display the numbers of current and total consumption. The user can play with turning 
devices on and off in different rooms at the same time.

The system also integrates statistics about the current consuption of each utility compared to 
the full consumption capacity of the household.
